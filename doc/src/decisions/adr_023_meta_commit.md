# ADR-023: Meta Commit Strategy for Release Please Integration

:material-star: **Critical Decision** | :material-calendar: **2025-05-28** | :material-check-circle: **Accepted**

## Problem Statement

Fork management requires synchronizing upstream commits that don't follow conventional commit format with Release Please automation that requires conventional commits for versioning decisions. This creates a fundamental conflict between preserving upstream commit history for enterprise debugging and maintaining automated release management.

## Context and Requirements

### :material-alert-circle: Upstream and Automation Conflict

**Upstream Repository Reality**:
- OSDU and other upstream repositories use varied commit message formats
- Commit messages often don't follow conventional commit standards (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)
- Enterprise environments require complete commit attribution and traceability
- Regulatory compliance demands complete audit trail preservation

**Release Please Requirements**:
- Needs conventional commits for semantic versioning decisions
- Analyzes commit messages to determine version bump type (major, minor, patch)
- Generates changelogs based on conventional commit categorization
- Validates commit message format before processing

**Enterprise Debugging Needs**:
- Complete OSDU commit history required for troubleshooting production issues
- Git blame and bisect functionality must remain intact for problem diagnosis
- Individual commit attribution essential for understanding change impact
- Regulatory audit trails require unmodified upstream commit preservation

### :material-target Solution Requirements

**History Preservation**: Maintain complete upstream commit history with original attribution for enterprise debugging.

**Automation Compatibility**: Enable Release Please to function with conventional commit analysis.

**Reliable Fallback**: Ensure workflow success regardless of AI service availability or analysis failures.

## Decision

Implement **Meta Commit Strategy** using AI-powered commit range analysis to bridge upstream history preservation with automation requirements:

### :material-git Meta Commit Implementation Strategy

#### **Four-Step Meta Commit Process**
```yaml
# Comprehensive meta commit implementation
meta_commit_process:
  step_1_capture_state: |
    # Capture repository state before upstream integration
    BEFORE_SHA=$(git rev-parse fork_upstream)
    echo "Captured pre-sync state: $BEFORE_SHA"
    
  step_2_merge_upstream: |
    # Merge upstream commits preserving original history
    git merge upstream/$DEFAULT_BRANCH -X theirs --no-edit
    echo "Upstream history merged preserving original attribution"
    
  step_3_ai_analysis: |
    # Use AI to analyze upstream changes and generate conventional commit
    if timeout 60s aipr commit --from $BEFORE_SHA --context "upstream sync" 2>/dev/null; then
      META_COMMIT_MSG=$(aipr commit --from $BEFORE_SHA --context "upstream sync")
      echo "AI-generated meta commit: $META_COMMIT_MSG"
      echo "ai_analysis_success=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      # Robust fallback for AI failures
      UPSTREAM_VERSION=$(git describe --tags upstream/$DEFAULT_BRANCH 2>/dev/null || echo "latest")
      META_COMMIT_MSG="feat: sync upstream changes from $UPSTREAM_VERSION"
      echo "Fallback meta commit: $META_COMMIT_MSG"
      echo "ai_analysis_success=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi
    
  step_4_meta_commit: |
    # Add conventional meta commit for Release Please processing
    git commit --allow-empty -m "$META_COMMIT_MSG"
    echo "Meta commit added for Release Please automation"
```

#### **AI-Enhanced Commit Analysis**
```yaml
# Advanced AI integration with AIPR 1.4.0+
ai_integration:
  tool_version: "AIPR 1.4.0+ with commit range analysis capability"
  
  analysis_configuration: |
    # AI analysis with specific context for upstream synchronization
    aipr commit \
      --from "$BEFORE_SHA" \
      --context "upstream sync" \
      --timeout 60 \
      --conventional-format
      
  analysis_scope:
    range: "Changes between last sync point and current HEAD"
    context: "upstream sync helps AI categorize appropriately"
    timeout: "60 seconds to prevent workflow hanging"
    format: "Ensures conventional commit format compliance"
    
  intelligent_categorization:
    features: "Detects new functionality in upstream changes"
    fixes: "Identifies bug fixes and patches"
    breaking_changes: "Recognizes API changes and breaking modifications"
    maintenance: "Categorizes refactoring and documentation updates"
```

### :material-shield-check Comprehensive Error Handling

#### **Robust Fallback Chain**
```yaml
# Multi-level fallback strategy ensuring workflow reliability
error_handling:
  ai_service_failure: |
    # Handle AI service outages gracefully
    if ! timeout 60s aipr commit --from $BEFORE_SHA --context "upstream sync" 2>/dev/null; then
      echo "⚠️ AI analysis failed or timed out, using fallback"
      
      # Generate descriptive fallback based on available information
      UPSTREAM_VERSION=$(git describe --tags upstream/$DEFAULT_BRANCH 2>/dev/null || echo "latest")
      COMMIT_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count $BEFORE_SHA..HEAD)
      
      if [ "$COMMIT_COUNT" -gt 10 ]; then
        META_COMMIT_MSG="feat: sync $COMMIT_COUNT upstream changes from $UPSTREAM_VERSION"
      else
        META_COMMIT_MSG="fix: sync upstream changes from $UPSTREAM_VERSION"
      fi
    fi
    
  validation_checks: |
    # Ensure meta commit meets conventional commit requirements
    if ! echo "$META_COMMIT_MSG" | grep -qE '^(feat|fix|chore|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci)(\(.+\))?: .{10,}$'; then
      echo "⚠️ Generated commit message doesn't meet conventional format, using safe fallback"
      META_COMMIT_MSG="feat: sync upstream changes"
    fi
    
  network_failures: |
    # Handle network connectivity issues
    if ! curl -s --connect-timeout 5 https://api.github.com >/dev/null; then
      echo "⚠️ Network connectivity issues detected, using offline fallback"
      META_COMMIT_MSG="feat: sync upstream changes (offline mode)"
    fi
```

## Implementation Strategy

    consistency: "Predictable behavior across all upstream sync operations"
    scalability: "Handles any volume of upstream changes"
```

### :material-artificial-intelligence Advanced AI Integration

#### **Intelligent Commit Categorization**
```yaml
# AI-powered upstream change analysis
intelligent_analysis:
  feature_detection:
    patterns: "New API endpoints, functionality additions, capability enhancements"
    categorization: "feat: commits for user-visible improvements"
    
  bug_fix_identification:
    patterns: "Error fixes, patch applications, security updates"
    categorization: "fix: commits for issue resolution"
    
  breaking_change_recognition:
    patterns: "API changes, configuration modifications, compatibility breaks"
    categorization: "feat!: or fix!: commits with BREAKING CHANGE footer"
    
  maintenance_categorization:
    patterns: "Documentation updates, refactoring, test improvements"
    categorization: "chore:, docs:, or refactor: commits as appropriate"
```
