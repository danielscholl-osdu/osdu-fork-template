## Overview

These Architecture Decision Records document the key design choices made in the Fork Management Template project. Each ADR explains the context, decision, rationale, and consequences of significant architectural choices that enable automated management of long-lived forks of upstream repositories.

## Quick Reference

### Core Architecture Decisions

**Three-Branch Strategy (ADR-001)**
- `main`: Stable production branch
- `fork_upstream`: Tracks upstream changes
- `fork_integration`: Conflict resolution workspace

**Automation Framework (ADR-002)**
- GitHub Actions for all workflow automation
- Self-configuring template repository pattern
- Scheduled and event-driven synchronization

**Two-Workflow Initialization (ADR-006)**
- Separated user interaction from repository setup
- Issue-driven configuration with progress updates
- Simplified state management and error handling

**Workflow Bootstrap Pattern (ADR-007)**
- Self-updating initialization workflows
- Ensures latest fixes are always available
- Solves the template version bootstrap problem

**Centralized Label Management (ADR-008)**
- All labels defined in `.github/labels.json`
- Created during repository initialization
- Single source of truth for label definitions

**Version Management (ADR-004)**
- Release Please with Conventional Commits
- Automated semantic versioning
- Upstream version reference tracking
