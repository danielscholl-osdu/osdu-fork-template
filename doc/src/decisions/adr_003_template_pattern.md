# ADR-003: Template Repository Pattern for Self-Configuration

:material-star: **Critical Decision** | :material-calendar: **2025-05-28** | :material-check-circle: **Accepted**

## Problem Statement

Teams need a way to quickly deploy fork management systems for different upstream repositories without manual configuration. The setup process is complex, involving branch structures, workflow configuration, security settings, and upstream connections that are error-prone and time-consuming when done manually.

## Context and Requirements

### :material-cog: Manual Setup Complexity

**Required Configuration Steps**:
- Creating and configuring three-branch hierarchy with proper relationships
- Setting up GitHub Actions workflows with repository-specific parameters
- Configuring branch protection rules and security settings
- Establishing upstream repository connection and sync settings
- Initializing project-specific build and validation configurations

### :material-target: Deployment Requirements

**Zero-Configuration Deployment**: Teams should be able to deploy a complete fork management system in under 5 minutes without technical expertise.

**Consistency Assurance**: All deployed repositories must follow identical patterns and configurations to ensure reliability and maintainability.

**Update Propagation**: Template improvements should benefit existing deployed repositories without manual intervention.

## Decision

Implement the fork management system as a **GitHub Template Repository** with intelligent self-configuration:

    B --> C[init.yml Auto-Triggers]
    C --> D[Creates Configuration Issue]

    E --> F[Validation & Setup]
    F --> G[Complete Fork Repository]

    style G fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c2185b,stroke-width:2px
```

### :material-file-cog: Template Architecture Components

#### **1. Template Repository Structure**
```yaml
# Repository marked as template with complete setup
template_repository:
  workflows: Complete GitHub Actions workflows with placeholders
  documentation: Comprehensive guides and ADRs  
  configurations: Branch protection, security, and build settings
  examples: Sample configurations for common scenarios
```

#### **2. Issue-Based Configuration Interface**
```yaml
# User-friendly configuration through GitHub Issues
configuration_process:
  trigger: Automatic issue creation by init.yml
  input_method: Simple comment-based upstream URL provision
  validation: Automated upstream repository accessibility verification
  feedback: Real-time progress updates and error reporting
```

#### **3. Self-Modifying Workflow System**
```yaml
# Workflows that configure themselves
self_configuration:
  parameter_injection: Repository-specific values inserted automatically
  branch_creation: Three-branch structure established with relationships
  security_setup: Branch protection and security settings applied
  upstream_connection: Remote repository configuration and initial sync
```

## Implementation Strategy

### :material-rocket: Deployment Process

#### **Phase 1: Template Creation**
```yaml
# One-click repository creation
- user_action: Click "Use this template"
- github_action: Create repository from template
- automatic_trigger: init.yml workflow activates immediately
- result: New repository with all template files copied
```

#### **Phase 2: Configuration Collection**
```yaml
# Issue-based configuration interface
- issue_creation: Automated configuration issue with instructions
- user_input: Upstream repository URL provided in issue comment
- validation: URL format and accessibility verification
- confirmation: Setup parameters validated and confirmed
```

#### **Phase 3: Automated Configuration**
```yaml
# Self-configuration process
- branch_setup: Three-branch structure created
- workflow_customization: Repository-specific parameters injected
- security_configuration: Branch protection and access controls applied
- upstream_connection: Remote repository linked and initial sync performed
```

### :material-security: Security and Reliability

#### **Validation Framework**
```yaml
# Comprehensive validation before setup
upstream_validation:
  url_format: Verify proper GitHub/GitLab URL format
  accessibility: Confirm repository is accessible
  permissions: Validate read access to upstream repository
  branch_detection: Identify upstream default branch
```

#### **Error Handling**
```yaml
# Robust error management
error_scenarios:
  invalid_url: Clear guidance on correct URL format
  inaccessible_repo: Instructions for access token configuration
  permission_issues: Step-by-step permission setup guide
  network_failures: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
```

## Rationale and Benefits

### :material-trending-up: Strategic Advantages

#### **User Experience Excellence**
