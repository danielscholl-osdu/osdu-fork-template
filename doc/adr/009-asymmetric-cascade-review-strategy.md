# ADR-009: Asymmetric Cascade Review Strategy

## Status
Accepted  
**Revised** - 2025-06-29

## Context
The cascade workflow moves upstream changes through a three-branch hierarchy:
1. `fork_upstream` â†’ `fork_integration` 
2. `fork_integration` â†’ `main`

With the implementation of human-centric cascade triggering (ADR-019) and issue lifecycle tracking (ADR-022), we needed to balance automation efficiency with safety, ensuring that upstream changes are properly vetted before reaching production while minimizing manual intervention where safe.

Key considerations:
- Upstream changes are external and potentially breaking
- Integration branch serves as a testing ground
- Main branch is production and must remain stable
- Manual cascade triggering provides explicit human control
- Conflict resolution always requires human intervention
- Issue tracking provides visibility into review status

## Decision
We will implement an asymmetric review strategy for cascade PRs:

1. **Fork_upstream â†’ Fork_integration**: Human-initiated with tracking
   - Triggered manually by humans after reviewing upstream sync PR
   - Issue lifecycle tracking provides visibility into integration status
   - Conflicts are most likely to occur here
   - Human judgment needed to assess upstream impact

2. **Fork_integration â†’ Main**: Always requires human review
   - All production PRs require manual approval before merge
   - Ensures final human oversight before changes reach production
   - Changes already validated in integration branch

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Safety First**: External changes get human review at entry point
- **Production Safety**: All production changes require final human approval
- **Clear Boundaries**: Integration branch serves its purpose as a validation gate
- **Risk Mitigation**: Human oversight at both critical decision points
- **Audit Trail**: Complete human review history for all production deployments

### Negative
- **Manual Overhead**: All production PRs require human review and approval
- **Potential Delays**: Manual review may slow deployment of routine updates
- **Review Fatigue**: Teams need to review both integration and production PRs

### Neutral
- **Monitoring Required**: Need to track manual review timing and bottlenecks
- **Process Efficiency**: Teams can develop patterns for faster routine reviews
- **Flexibility**: Emergency procedures can be established for critical fixes

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1 (Human-Initiated Integration)
```yaml
# Humans manually trigger cascade after reviewing sync PR
# Cascade workflow updates issue tracking
gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUMBER" \
  --remove-label "human-required" \
  --add-label "cascade-active"

# Integration proceeds with conflict detection
# If conflicts detected, issue updated to cascade-blocked
```

### Phase 2 (Conditionally Automatic)
```yaml
# Create production PR from fork_integration to main
MAIN_BRANCH="fork_integration"
PR_URL=$(gh pr create \
  --base main \
  --head $MAIN_BRANCH \
  --title "ðŸš€ Production Release: Upstream Integration - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
  --body "$PR_BODY" \
  --label "upstream-sync,production-ready,cascade-active,validated,human-required")

# Update tracking issue
gh issue edit "$TRACKING_ISSUE" \
  --remove-label "cascade-active" \
  --add-label "production-ready"

# All production PRs require manual review
gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --add-label "manual-review-required"
```

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Fully Automated**: Auto-merge at both stages when clean
   - Rejected: Too risky for external changes reaching production

2. **Conditional Auto-merge**: Auto-merge second stage based on size/changes
   - Rejected: Even clean changes benefit from human oversight before production

3. **Reversed Asymmetry**: Auto-merge first stage, manual second
   - Rejected: Backwards from a safety perspective
