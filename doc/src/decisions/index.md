## Quick Reference Guide

### :material-lightbulb: Key Architectural Principles

**Three-Branch Safety**: All changes flow through `fork_upstream` → `fork_integration` → `main` with validation at each stage.

**Human-Centric Automation**: Automation enhances human workflows rather than replacing human judgment, with clear escalation paths.

**AI Enhancement**: AI capabilities improve workflow quality while maintaining reliable fallback mechanisms.

**Template Pattern**: Repository templates enable consistent deployment with automated updates and configuration.

### :material-chart-timeline: Common Decision Patterns

**Event-Driven Architecture**: Workflows trigger based on GitHub events with monitoring for missed triggers.

**Label-Based State Management**: GitHub labels provide machine-readable state with human-friendly interfaces.

**Multi-Provider Resilience**: Critical integrations support multiple providers to prevent single points of failure.

**Configuration-Driven Behavior**: JSON configuration files control workflow behavior without code changes.

### :material-arrow-decision: Impact Assessment

**:material-star: Critical Decisions**: Fundamental to system operation - changes require careful migration planning.

**:material-trending-up: High Impact**: Significant workflow effects - changes affect multiple components.

**:material-minus: Medium Impact**: Localized improvements - changes have bounded effects.
