      "Bash(--body \"## Problem\n\nThe sync-state-manager action has a critical bug in its cleanup logic that causes PR branches to be deleted while PRs are still open. This happens when the \\`gh\\` command fails due to missing \\`GH_TOKEN\\` environment variable.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nFrom sync workflow logs, we discovered:\n1. PR created successfully on Day 1 ✅\n2. Day 2 sync runs cleanup logic\n3. \\`gh pr list\\` fails with: \\`gh: To use GitHub CLI in a GitHub Actions workflow, set the GH_TOKEN environment variable\\` ❌\n4. Cleanup logic assumes no PR exists and deletes the branch ❌\n5. Sync workflow fails when trying to update non-existent branch ❌\n\n## Changes Made\n\n- **Added \\`GH_TOKEN\\` environment variable** to cleanup step (lines 128-129)\n- **Added proper error handling** for \\`gh\\` command failures (lines 160-162)\n- **Implemented fail-safe approach** - skip cleanup when \\`gh\\` commands fail\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Before**: PR branches deleted while PRs are open, causing workflow failures\n- **After**: Safe cleanup that only deletes truly abandoned branches\n\n## Testing\n\nThe fix addresses the exact scenario that caused the original issue in the partition repository sync workflow.\n\nFixes #129\" )",

Detects available LLM providers (Anthropic > Azure OpenAI > OpenAI)\n2. Calculates diff size to avoid token limits\n3. Generates AI-enhanced PR description using AIPR\n4.
