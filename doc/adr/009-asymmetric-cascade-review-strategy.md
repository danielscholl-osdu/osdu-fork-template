# ADR-009: Asymmetric Cascade Review Strategy

## Status
Accepted  
**Revised** - 2025-06-29

## Context
The cascade workflow moves upstream changes through a three-branch hierarchy:
1. `fork_upstream` â†’ `fork_integration` 
2. `fork_integration` â†’ `main`

With the implementation of human-centric cascade triggering (ADR-019) and issue lifecycle tracking (ADR-022), we needed to balance automation efficiency with safety, ensuring that upstream changes are properly vetted before reaching production while minimizing manual intervention where safe.

Key considerations:
- Upstream changes are external and potentially breaking
- Integration branch serves as a testing ground
- Main branch is production and must remain stable
- Manual cascade triggering provides explicit human control
- Conflict resolution always requires human intervention
- Issue tracking provides visibility into review status

## Decision
We will implement an asymmetric review strategy for cascade PRs:

1. **Fork_upstream â†’ Fork_integration**: Human-initiated with comprehensive validation
   - Triggered manually by humans after reviewing upstream sync PR
   - Issue lifecycle tracking provides visibility into integration status
   - Conflicts are most likely to occur here
   - Human judgment needed to assess upstream impact
   - **Comprehensive validation**: Build, test, and lint checks run on integration branch
   - **Validation failures**: Block cascade and create detailed failure issues

2. **Fork_integration â†’ Main**: Always requires human review  
   - All production PRs require manual approval before merge
   - Ensures final human oversight before changes reach production
   - Changes already validated and proven stable in integration branch
   - **Quality gate**: Only validated changes that pass all checks reach production

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Safety First**: External changes get human review at entry point
- **Production Safety**: All production changes require final human approval
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive build, test, and validation on integration branch
- **Early Detection**: Integration validation catches issues before production PRs
- **Clear Boundaries**: Integration branch serves its purpose as a true validation gate
- **Risk Mitigation**: Human oversight and automated validation at both critical decision points
- **Audit Trail**: Complete human review history and validation logs for all production deployments
- **Issue Tracking**: Detailed failure tracking with error logs and resolution guidance

### Negative
- **Manual Overhead**: All production PRs require human review and approval
- **Potential Delays**: Manual review may slow deployment of routine updates
- **Review Fatigue**: Teams need to review both integration and production PRs

### Neutral
- **Monitoring Required**: Need to track manual review timing and bottlenecks
- **Process Efficiency**: Teams can develop patterns for faster routine reviews
- **Flexibility**: Emergency procedures can be established for critical fixes

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1 (Human-Initiated Integration with Validation)
```yaml
# Humans manually trigger cascade after reviewing sync PR
# Cascade workflow updates issue tracking
gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUMBER" \
  --remove-label "human-required" \
  --add-label "cascade-active"

# Integration proceeds with merge and comprehensive validation
# 1. Merge fork_upstream to fork_integration (conflict detection)
# 2. Run comprehensive validation (build, test, lint)
# 3. Report validation results to tracking issue

# If conflicts detected OR validation fails:
#   - Issue updated to cascade-blocked
#   - Detailed failure issue created with logs and resolution steps
#   - Cascade to main blocked until resolution
```

### Phase 2 (Production PR Creation - Only After Validation Passes)
```yaml
# Production PR only created if integration validation successful
# Condition: integration_success == 'true' && conflicts_found == 'false'

# Create production PR from validated fork_integration to main
RELEASE_BRANCH="release/upstream-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
PR_URL=$(gh pr create \
  --base main \
  --head $RELEASE_BRANCH \
  --title "ðŸš€ Production Release: Upstream Integration - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
  --body "$PR_BODY" \
  --label "upstream-sync,human-required")

# Update tracking issue - production PR created
gh issue comment "$TRACKING_ISSUE" --body "ðŸŽ¯ **Production PR Created** - $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)

Integration completed successfully! Production PR has been created and is ready for final review."

# All production PRs require manual review (implicit)
```

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Fully Automated**: Auto-merge at both stages when clean
   - Rejected: Too risky for external changes reaching production

2. **Conditional Auto-merge**: Auto-merge second stage based on size/changes
   - Rejected: Even clean changes benefit from human oversight before production

3. **Reversed Asymmetry**: Auto-merge first stage, manual second
   - Rejected: Backwards from a safety perspective
