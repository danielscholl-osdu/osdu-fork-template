# ADR-009: Asymmetric Cascade Review Strategy

:material-star: **Critical Decision** | :material-calendar: **2025-05-28** | :material-check-circle: **Accepted** | :material-refresh: **Revised** 2025-06-29

## Problem Statement

The cascade workflow moves upstream changes through a three-branch hierarchy requiring careful balance between automation efficiency and safety controls. With human-centric cascade triggering and issue lifecycle tracking implemented, a strategic review approach was needed to ensure proper validation while minimizing unnecessary manual intervention.

## Context and Requirements

### :material-alert-circle: Cascade Review Challenges

**Multi-Stage Risk Assessment**:
- Upstream changes are external and potentially breaking, requiring careful evaluation
- Integration branch serves as testing ground but needs validation to be meaningful
- Main branch represents production and must maintain absolute stability
- Different risk profiles exist at each cascade stage requiring tailored approaches

**Human Control and Automation Balance**:
- Manual cascade triggering provides explicit human control over integration timing
- Conflict resolution always requires human intervention regardless of automation
- Issue tracking provides visibility but teams need clear review expectations
- Validation failures must be clearly communicated with actionable resolution guidance

**Quality Assurance Integration**:
- Comprehensive validation (build, test, lint) needed before production deployment
- Early detection of issues prevents problems from reaching production branch
- Clear quality gates required to maintain integration branch integrity
- Detailed failure tracking with logs and resolution steps for troubleshooting

### :material-target Review Strategy Requirements

**Safety-First Architecture**: External changes receive appropriate human review at critical decision points while maintaining efficiency.

**Production Protection**: All production changes require final human oversight with comprehensive validation before deployment.

**Efficient Workflow**: Minimize unnecessary manual intervention while maintaining safety and quality standards.

## Decision

Implement an **Asymmetric Cascade Review Strategy** with differentiated approaches for each cascade stage:

### :material-shield-check Phase 1: Human-Initiated Integration with Comprehensive Validation

#### **Manual Trigger with Issue Tracking Integration**
```yaml
# Human-initiated cascade after upstream sync review
phase_1_integration:
  trigger: "Manual cascade trigger after sync PR review and merge"
  
  process_flow: |
    # Human triggers cascade workflow manually
    # Cascade workflow updates issue tracking immediately
    gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUMBER" \
      --remove-label "human-required" \
      --add-label "cascade-active"
    
    # Progress notification
    gh issue comment "$ISSUE_NUMBER" --body "🚀 **Cascade Integration Started** - $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
    
    Integration workflow triggered manually and now processing upstream changes.
    
    **Phase 1:** Merging \`fork_upstream\` → \`fork_integration\`
    **Validation:** Comprehensive build, test, and lint checks will run"
```

#### **Comprehensive Validation Framework**
```yaml
# Extensive validation on integration branch
validation_framework:
  merge_validation: |
    # Attempt merge with conflict detection
    if git merge origin/fork_upstream --no-edit; then
      echo "✅ Clean merge of upstream changes achieved"
      echo "conflicts=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "🚨 Merge conflicts detected - human resolution required"
      echo "conflicts=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      # Update issue tracking and create conflict issue
    fi
    
  build_validation: |
    # Comprehensive build validation
    if ./scripts/build.sh; then
      echo "✅ Build validation passed"
      echo "build_success=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "❌ Build validation failed"
      echo "build_success=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      # Capture build logs for failure issue
    fi
    
  test_validation: |
    # Complete test suite execution
    if ./scripts/test.sh; then
      echo "✅ Test validation passed"  
      echo "test_success=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "❌ Test validation failed"
      echo "test_success=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      # Capture test logs for failure issue
    fi
    
  lint_validation: |
    # Code quality and style validation
    if ./scripts/lint.sh; then
      echo "✅ Lint validation passed"
      echo "lint_success=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "❌ Lint validation failed"
      echo "lint_success=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      # Capture lint logs for failure issue
    fi
```

#### **Validation Failure Handling**
```yaml
# Detailed failure tracking and resolution guidance
validation_failure_handling:
  failure_detection: |
    # Check if any validation failed
    if [[ "${{ steps.validation.outputs.conflicts }}" == "true" ]] || \
       [[ "${{ steps.validation.outputs.build_success }}" == "false" ]] || \
       [[ "${{ steps.validation.outputs.test_success }}" == "false" ]] || \
       [[ "${{ steps.validation.outputs.lint_success }}" == "false" ]]; then
      echo "validation_failed=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi
    
  failure_issue_creation: |
    # Create detailed failure issue with logs and resolution steps
    FAILURE_BODY="## 🚨 Cascade Validation Failure
    
    Integration validation failed during cascade process. Manual resolution required.
    
    **Failure Summary:**
    - **Conflicts:** ${{ steps.validation.outputs.conflicts }}
    - **Build:** ${{ steps.validation.outputs.build_success }}
    - **Tests:** ${{ steps.validation.outputs.test_success }}
    - **Lint:** ${{ steps.validation.outputs.lint_success }}
    
    **Resolution Steps:**
    1. Checkout the fork_integration branch locally
    2. Address the specific validation failures listed above
    3. Commit and push fixes to fork_integration
    4. Remove 'human-required' label from tracking issue to retry cascade
    
    **Logs and Details:**
    [Detailed failure logs attached]"
    
    gh issue create \
      --title "🚨 Cascade Validation Failure - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
      --body "$FAILURE_BODY" \
      --label "cascade-failed,human-required,high-priority"
```

### :material-security Phase 2: Production PR Creation with Human Review Requirement

#### **Conditional Production PR Creation**
```yaml
# Production PR only created after successful validation
phase_2_production:
  condition: "Only proceeds if all validation passes and no conflicts detected"
  
  pr_creation: |
    # Only create production PR if integration validation successful
    if [[ "${{ steps.validation.outputs.validation_failed }}" != "true" ]]; then
      # Create production release branch
      RELEASE_BRANCH="release/upstream-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
      git checkout -b "$RELEASE_BRANCH" fork_integration
      git push origin "$RELEASE_BRANCH"
      
      # Create production PR with human review requirement
      PR_URL=$(gh pr create \
        --base main \
        --head "$RELEASE_BRANCH" \
        --title "🚀 Production Release: Upstream Integration - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
        --body "$PRODUCTION_PR_BODY" \
        --label "upstream-sync,human-required,production")
        
      echo "production_pr_created=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      echo "production_pr_url=$PR_URL" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "Skipping production PR creation due to validation failures"
      echo "production_pr_created=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi
```
