# ADR-020: Human-Required Label Strategy

:material-star: **Critical Decision** | :material-calendar: **2025-06-20** | :material-check-circle: **Accepted** | :material-refresh: **Revised** 2025-06-29

## Problem Statement

GitHub workflows frequently need to create issues and pull requests requiring human attention. Traditional assignee-based approaches create significant reliability, maintainability, and scalability challenges that block critical automation processes and limit template repository effectiveness.

## Context and Requirements

### :material-alert-circle: Assignee-Based Task Management Problems

**Username Resolution Issues**:
- GitHub's GraphQL API requires exact usernames for assignment operations
- Organization names cannot be assigned to issues, causing API validation failures
- Different workflows run in varying contexts with different triggering users
- Template repositories need flexible assignment across multiple instances

**Workflow Reliability Challenges**:
- Invalid usernames cause workflow failures with cryptic GraphQL errors
- Error messages like "Could not resolve to a User with the login of 'organization-name'"
- Hardcoded usernames become stale and require constant maintenance
- Cross-repository template complexity when deployment contexts vary

**Problematic Implementation Patterns**:
```yaml
# Common failing patterns
--assignee "${{ github.repository_owner }}"  # Organization name (invalid)
--assignee "hardcoded-username"              # Brittle and unmaintainable  
--assignee "${{ github.actor }}"             # Context-dependent failures
```

### :material-target: Task Management Requirements

**Reliable Workflow Execution**: Task assignment should never cause workflow failures or block critical automation processes.

**Template Repository Compatibility**: Assignment approach must work identically across all template instances without configuration.

**Flexible Team Organization**: Support various team structures and workflows without hardcoded assumptions about users or roles.

## Decision

Replace assignee-based task management with a **Human-Required Label Strategy** using GitHub's robust label system for task visibility and workflow coordination:

    style F fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#e65100,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c2185b,stroke-width:2px
```

### :material-label-outline: Core Label Strategy

#### **Primary Human-Required Label**
```yaml
# Core task identification
human_required_label:
  name: "human-required"
  description: "Requires human intervention or review"
  color: "D73A49"
  usage: Applied to all issues/PRs needing human attention
  reliability: Never fails - no username validation required
```

#### **Supporting Classification Labels**
```yaml
# Enhanced task categorization
classification_labels:
  priority:
    - high-priority: Urgent items requiring immediate attention
    - emergency: Critical system issues requiring escalation
  
  type:
    - conflict: Merge conflicts requiring manual resolution
    - sync-failed: Failed synchronization operations
    - escalation: Issues that have exceeded SLA timeouts
    - cascade-trigger-failed: Failed cascade workflow triggers
  
  lifecycle:
    - upstream-sync: Issues related to upstream synchronization
    - cascade-active: Cascade integration currently in progress
    - cascade-blocked: Cascade blocked by conflicts or issues
    - production-ready: Ready for production deployment
    - validated: Integration complete, validation successful
```

### :material-workflow: Enhanced Workflow Implementation

#### **Robust Issue Creation Pattern**
```yaml
# Before: Problematic assignee-based approach
problematic_pattern:
  validation: Complex username resolution logic
  assignment: --assignee validation with multiple fallbacks
  failure_points: API validation, username resolution, context issues
  maintenance: Hardcoded usernames requiring updates

# After: Label-based approach
robust_pattern:
  creation: Simple issue creation with human-required label
  classification: Context-appropriate additional labels
  reliability: No username validation or API failures
  maintenance: Zero hardcoded user dependencies
```

#### **Lifecycle Management Through Labels**
```yaml
# Dynamic label updates during workflow progression
lifecycle_management:
  initial_state: upstream-sync + human-required
  work_begins: Remove human-required, add cascade-active
  conflicts_detected: Add cascade-blocked + conflict
  resolution_complete: Update to production-ready
  deployment_finished: Close issue, remove all lifecycle labels
```

## Implementation Strategy

### :material-cog-sync-outline Enhanced Workflow Patterns

#### **Issue Creation Replacement**
```yaml
# New robust issue creation pattern
issue_creation:
  before: |
    # Complex validation logic (prone to failures)
    ASSIGNEE="${{ github.actor }}"
    if gh api users/"$ASSIGNEE" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      ASSIGNEE_FLAG="--assignee $ASSIGNEE"
    else
      ASSIGNEE_FLAG=""
    fi
    
    gh issue create \
      --title "Issue requiring attention" \
      --body "Issue details..." \
      --label "some-label" \
      $ASSIGNEE_FLAG

  after: |
    # Simple, reliable label-based approach
    gh issue create \
      --title "ðŸ“¥ Upstream Sync Ready for Review - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
      --body "$NOTIFICATION_BODY" \
      --label "upstream-sync,human-required"
```

#### **Dynamic Label Management**
```yaml
# Real-time label updates during workflow execution
label_updates:
  cascade_start: |
    gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUMBER" \
      --remove-label "human-required" \
      --add-label "cascade-active"
      
  conflict_detection: |
    gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUMBER" \
      --remove-label "cascade-active" \
      --add-label "cascade-blocked,conflict,high-priority"
      
  production_ready: |
    gh issue edit "$ISSUE_NUMBER" \
      --remove-label "cascade-active" \
      --add-label "production-ready"
```

### :material-filter-outline Team Workflow Integration

#### **GitHub Issue Filtering Patterns**
```yaml
# Efficient team filtering strategies
filtering_patterns:
  daily_queue: "label:human-required label:high-priority"
  conflict_focus: "label:human-required label:conflict"
  cascade_monitoring: "label:upstream-sync label:cascade-active"
  emergency_response: "label:human-required label:emergency"
  
  lifecycle_tracking:
    needs_trigger: "label:upstream-sync label:human-required"
    in_progress: "label:upstream-sync label:cascade-active"
    blocked: "label:upstream-sync label:cascade-blocked"
    ready_deploy: "label:upstream-sync label:production-ready"
```

#### **Project Board Automation**
```yaml
# Automated project board organization
project_automation:
  needs_attention: "label:human-required â†’ 'Needs Attention' column"
  urgent_items: "label:high-priority â†’ 'Urgent' column"
  conflicts: "label:conflict â†’ 'Conflicts' column"
  in_progress: "Remove human-required when work starts"
```

### :material-account-supervisor-circle Team Adoption Framework

#### **Individual Developer Workflows**
```yaml
# Efficient developer workflow patterns
developer_workflows:
  morning_review: |
    # Check high-priority items first
    https://github.com/org/repo/issues?q=is:open+label:human-required+label:high-priority
    
  weekly_triage: |
    # Review all human-required items
    https://github.com/org/repo/issues?q=is:open+label:human-required
    
  conflict_specialization: |
    # Focus on conflict resolution
    https://github.com/org/repo/issues?q=is:open+label:conflict+label:human-required
```

- **Audit Trail**: Complete visibility into issue classification and progression

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### :material-close-circle: Enhanced User Validation

**Approach**: Complex validation logic with multiple fallback strategies

```yaml
# Multi-stage user resolution attempt
if gh api users/"${{ github.actor }}" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  ASSIGNEE_FLAG="--assignee ${{ github.actor }}"
elif gh api users/"${{ github.repository_owner }}" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  ASSIGNEE_FLAG="--assignee ${{ github.repository_owner }}"
else
  ASSIGNEE_FLAG="--assignee $(gh api /repos/:owner/:repo/collaborators --jq '.[0].login')"
fi
```

- **Pros**: Maintains traditional assignment approach
- **Cons**: Complex logic, API rate limiting, still fails in edge cases, fragile
- **Decision**: Rejected due to complexity and fundamental reliability issues

### :material-close-circle: Configuration-Based Assignment

**Approach**: Repository variables for assignee configuration

```yaml
# Configurable assignment approach
--assignee "${{ vars.DEFAULT_ASSIGNEE }}"
```

- **Pros**: Configurable per repository deployment
- **Cons**: Still requires username validation, manual setup overhead, maintenance burden
- **Decision**: Rejected due to configuration complexity and maintenance requirements

### :material-close-circle: External Assignment Service

**Approach**: Dedicated service for sophisticated assignment logic

- **Pros**: Could handle complex assignment rules and validation
- **Cons**: Additional infrastructure, external dependencies, single point of failure
- **Decision**: Rejected as over-engineering for task assignment requirements

### :material-close-circle: Hybrid Assignment and Labels

**Approach**: Attempt assignment with label fallback

```yaml
# Best-of-both-worlds attempt
if [[ -n "${{ vars.DEFAULT_ASSIGNEE }}" ]]; then
  --assignee "${{ vars.DEFAULT_ASSIGNEE }}"
fi
--label "human-required"
```

- **Pros**: Combines benefits of both approaches
- **Cons**: Still susceptible to assignment failures, increased complexity
- **Decision**: Rejected in favor of label-only simplicity and reliability
