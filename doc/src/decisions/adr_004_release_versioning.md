# ADR-004: Release Please for Automated Version Management

:material-star: **Critical Decision** | :material-calendar: **2025-05-28** | :material-check-circle: **Accepted**

## Problem Statement

Fork repositories require sophisticated automated version management that can handle both local modifications and upstream integration while maintaining semantic versioning principles and generating clear changelog documentation. Traditional fork versioning approaches often fail to distinguish between local changes and upstream integration, creating unclear version histories and confusing release documentation.

## Context and Requirements

### :material-alert-circle: Fork Version Management Challenges

**Dual-Source Change Complexity**:
- Need to distinguish between local enhancements and upstream integration changes
- Version numbers must reflect both fork evolution and upstream alignment
- Changelog generation requires attribution of changes to local vs upstream sources
- Release tags should reference both local and upstream version relationships

**Automation Requirements**:
- Semantic versioning based on standardized commit message conventions
- Automated changelog generation with meaningful categorization and formatting
- Release process automation without manual intervention or human approval gates
- Integration with three-branch fork management strategy for consistent workflow

**Documentation and Transparency**:
- Meaningful changelogs that clearly communicate change impact and source
- Release tags that maintain relationship between fork and upstream versions
- Clear audit trail for all version decisions and change attribution
- Team communication improvements through standardized commit messaging

### :material-target: Version Management Requirements

**Conventional Commit Integration**: Standardized commit message format enabling automated version determination and change categorization.

**Fork-Aware Versioning**: Version management system that understands and handles fork-specific versioning needs including upstream references.

**Automated Release Pipeline**: Complete automation from commit to release without manual intervention while maintaining quality and accuracy.

## Decision

Adopt **Google's Release Please action** for automated version management with Conventional Commits integration:

    style M fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c2185b,stroke-width:2px
```

### :material-format-text Conventional Commits Foundation

#### **Standardized Commit Format**
```yaml
# Conventional commit structure
commit_format:
  pattern: "<type>[optional scope]: <description>"
  body: "[optional body explaining the change]"
  footer: "[optional footer(s) with breaking changes]"
  
  examples:
    feature: "feat(auth): add OAuth integration for upstream sync"
    bugfix: "fix(cascade): resolve conflict detection in merge workflow"
    breaking: "feat!: migrate to new upstream API (BREAKING CHANGE)"
    upstream: "upstream: integrate v2.3.1 changes from upstream repository"
```

#### **Version Bump Mapping**
```yaml
# Semantic version determination rules
version_bumps:
  major: "BREAKING CHANGE footer or ! after type"
  minor: "feat type commits"
  patch: "fix type commits"
  
  no_bump:
    - docs: Documentation only changes
    - style: Code style/formatting changes
    - refactor: Code refactoring without feature changes
    - test: Test additions or modifications
    - chore: Maintenance tasks and tooling updates
```

### :material-auto-fix Release Please Configuration

#### **Fork-Optimized Setup**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml configuration
release_please_config:
  release_type: "simple"
  package_name: "fork-management-template"
  
  changelog_types:
    features: 
      type: "feat"
      section: "‚ú® New Features"
      hidden: false
    
    fixes:
      type: "fix" 
      section: "üêõ Bug Fixes"
      hidden: false
      
    upstream:
      type: "upstream"
      section: "üîÑ Upstream Integration"
      hidden: false
      
    maintenance:
      type: "chore"
      section: "üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance"
      hidden: false
```

#### **Fork-Specific Enhancements**
```yaml
# Enhanced release management for forks
fork_enhancements:
  upstream_tags: "Release tags include upstream version references"
  change_attribution: "Commits marked with source (local vs upstream)"
  integration_notes: "Special handling for upstream integration commits"
  version_correlation: "Changelog includes upstream version relationship"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### :material-cog-sync Automated Workflow Integration

        with:
          config-file: .release-please-config.json
          manifest-file: .release-please-manifest.json
```

#### **Enhanced Changelog Generation**
```yaml
# Fork-aware changelog configuration
changelog_enhancements:
  upstream_integration:
