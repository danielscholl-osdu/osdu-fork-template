# ADR-008: Centralized Label Management Strategy

:material-star: **Critical Decision** | :material-calendar: **2025-05-28** | :material-check-circle: **Accepted**

## Problem Statement

The Fork Management Template uses GitHub labels extensively to track workflow states, issue types, and PR statuses across multiple automated workflows. The original distributed approach where each workflow created its own labels created reliability, consistency, and maintainability challenges that undermined automation effectiveness.

## Context and Requirements

### :material-alert-circle: Distributed Label Management Problems

**Workflow Dependencies and Reliability**:
- Labels didn't exist until specific workflows executed, potentially breaking automation
- New workflows couldn't reliably depend on required labels being available
- Race conditions when multiple workflows tried to create the same labels
- Failed workflows could leave label creation incomplete, breaking subsequent automation

**Consistency and Maintenance Issues**:
- No single source of truth for label definitions across the system
- Inconsistent label colors, descriptions, and naming conventions
- Difficult to maintain and document comprehensive label usage patterns
- Each workflow implementation contained its own label creation logic

**Distributed Creation Pattern Problems**:
```yaml
# Problematic distributed approach
sync_workflow: "Creates sync-related labels during first run"
init_workflow: "Creates initialization labels when triggered"
dependabot_workflow: "Creates dependency labels as needed"
cascade_workflow: "Requires additional state-tracking labels"
```

### :material-target: Label Management Requirements

**Centralized Definition**: Single source of truth for all system labels with consistent formatting and documentation.

**Initialization Guarantee**: All required labels available from repository initialization without workflow execution dependencies.

**Automation Reliability**: Workflows can assume label existence and focus on core functionality rather than infrastructure setup.

## Decision

Implement a **centralized label management strategy** with comprehensive initialization and maintenance:

    style J fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c2185b,stroke-width:2px
```

### :material-file-document-outline Centralized Configuration Architecture

#### **Single Source of Truth**
```yaml
# .github/labels.json structure
label_configuration:
  location: ".github/labels.json"
  format: "Structured JSON with name, description, color"
  versioning: "Git-tracked with complete change history"
  documentation: "Self-documenting through descriptive names and descriptions"
```

#### **Comprehensive Label Taxonomy**
```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "name": "upstream-sync",
      "description": "Issues related to upstream repository synchronization",
      "color": "1976d2"
    },
    {
      "name": "cascade-active", 
      "description": "Currently processing through cascade integration pipeline",
      "color": "0e8a16"
    },
    {
      "name": "human-required",
      "description": "Requires human intervention or review",
      "color": "d73a49"
    },
    {
      "name": "conflict",
      "description": "Merge conflicts requiring manual resolution",
      "color": "e53e3e"
    }
  ]
}
```

### :material-cog Automated Label Creation Process

#### **Initialization Workflow Integration**
```yaml
# Enhanced initialization with label creation
name: "Create all system labels"
implementation: |
  # Read and parse label configuration
  labels=$(cat .github/labels.json | jq -r '.labels[] | @base64')
  
  for label in $labels; do
    # Decode and extract label properties
    decoded=$(echo $label | base64 --decode)
    name=$(echo $decoded | jq -r '.name')
    description=$(echo $decoded | jq -r '.description')  
    color=$(echo $decoded | jq -r '.color')
    
    # Create or update label with full properties
    gh label create "$name" \
      --description "$description" \
      --color "$color" \
      --force
  done
```

#### **Workflow Assumption Pattern**
```yaml
# Workflows now operate with label assumptions
workflow_pattern:
  assumption: "All required labels exist from initialization"
  usage: "Direct label application without creation logic"
  reliability: "No workflow failures due to missing labels"
  
  example: |
    # Simple, reliable label application
    gh issue create \
      --title "Upstream sync ready for review" \
      --body "$NOTIFICATION_BODY" \
      --label "upstream-sync,human-required"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### :material-timeline-check Label Lifecycle Management

#### **Complete Label Taxonomy**
```yaml
# Comprehensive system label categories
label_categories:
  workflow_state:
    - cascade-active: Integration pipeline in progress
    - cascade-blocked: Integration blocked by conflicts
    - production-ready: Ready for production deployment
    - validated: Integration complete and validated
    
  issue_types:
    - upstream-sync: Upstream synchronization activities
    - conflict: Merge conflicts requiring resolution
    - escalation: Issues exceeding SLA timeouts
    - template-sync: Template update activities
    
  priority_levels:
    - high-priority: Urgent items requiring immediate attention
    - emergency: Critical system issues needing escalation
    
  human_interaction:
    - human-required: Requires human intervention or review
    - review-needed: Code review or validation required
```

#### **Color Scheme Standardization**
```yaml
# Consistent color palette
color_scheme:
  workflow_active: "0e8a16" # Green - active processes
  workflow_blocked: "e53e3e" # Red - blocked or failed states  
  human_required: "d73a49" # Dark red - human intervention needed
  information: "1976d2" # Blue - informational or tracking
  priority_high: "ff6b35" # Orange - high priority items
  emergency: "b71c1c" # Dark red - emergency situations
```

### :material-refresh Label Maintenance Process

#### **Update Workflow**
```yaml
# Label modification process
update_process:
  modify: "Edit .github/labels.json with new definitions"
  commit: "Git commit tracks all label changes"
  deploy: "Re-run label creation during next initialization"
  verify: "Confirm labels applied correctly across repository"
```

#### **Migration Strategy**
```yaml
# Existing repository migration
migration_approach:
  audit: "Identify existing labels and their usage"
  consolidate: "Map existing labels to centralized definitions"
  update: "Apply new label configuration"
  cleanup: "Remove orphaned or deprecated labels"
```
